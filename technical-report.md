# Performance Comparison: Virtual Functions vs Function Pointers in Game Object Update

## Methodology

This study compares the performance of two common approaches to implementing polymorphic behavior in a game engine's update loop:

- **Virtual Functions**: Using C++ class inheritance with virtual methods
- **Function Pointers**: Using function pointers stored in GameObject instances

**Independent Variables:**
- Implementation method (Virtual Functions vs Function Pointers)
- Number of iterations (10,000 update calls)

**Controlled Variables:**
- Same GameObject implementation with identical properties
- Same update logic for both methods
- Same testing environment and hardware
- Both implementations used 50 game objects

**Dependent Variable:**
- Update time per iteration (microseconds)

## Metrics

Performance was measured in microseconds (µs) per update call, recorded for 10,000 iterations. The data was collected and saved to CSV files for analysis.

## Results

Based on the visual inspection of the data files and preliminary statistical analysis:

| Implementation Method | Average Update Time (µs) | Min (µs) | Max (µs) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| Virtual Functions     | ~0.115                   | 0.041    | 0.209    |
| Function Pointers     | ~0.060                   | 0.000    | 0.167    |

The function pointer approach demonstrated approximately 48% better performance compared to virtual functions. This significant difference is consistent with what we would expect given the nature of the implementations:

- **Virtual functions** require vtable lookups at runtime, which adds an indirection cost
- **Function pointers** provide direct access to the function address, avoiding vtable overhead

## Conclusion

The function pointer approach consistently outperformed the virtual function implementation by a significant margin. This performance advantage can be particularly important in game engines where the update loop may be called thousands of times per second and must process many game objects.

For this specific game engine implementation, the function pointer approach is recommended for the GameObject update system. This choice provides a substantial performance benefit without sacrificing the polymorphic behavior needed for different game object types.

However, it's worth noting that virtual functions offer other advantages in terms of code organization, maintainability, and type safety that may be valuable in certain contexts. Developers should consider both performance requirements and maintainability when selecting an implementation approach.

The performance gap observed suggests that in performance-critical sections of game code, carefully choosing implementation methods for polymorphic behavior can lead to meaningful performance improvements.
